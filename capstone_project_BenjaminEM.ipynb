            "1. Purpose:\n",
            "The purpose of this Python code snippet is to convert a string of comma-separated numbers into a list of integers. This fulfills the instruction provided, which required creating a Python code to handle input like \"1,2,3,4,5,6\" and convert it into a list format suitable for numerical operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. How it Works:\n",
            "- First, the code assigns the string '1,2,3,4,5,6' to the variable `numbers`.\n",
            "- The line `numbers.split(',')` splits this string into a list of substrings using the comma (`,`) as a delimiter. The result is `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']`.\n",
            "- The list comprehension `[int(x) for x in numbers.split(',')]` then iterates over each element (`x`) in the list obtained from the previous step. For each `x`, it applies the `int()` function to convert the string representation of a number into an integer.\n",
            "- As a result, a new list `numbers_list` is created containing the integer values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n",
            "- Finally, the `print(numbers_list)` statement outputs this list to the console.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Key Concepts/Libraries:\n",
            "- **String Splitting:** The `split()` method is a built-in Python string method that divides a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a comma (`,`).\n",
            "- **List Comprehension:** This is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of brackets `[]` enclosing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The expression is evaluated once for each item in the input list (or other iterable), and the results are collected into a new list.\n",
            "- **Type Conversion:** The `int()` function is used to convert a string or a number (in string format) to an integer.\n",
            "\n",
            "This code efficiently converts a comma-separated string of numbers into a list of integers using basic Python functionalities without the need for external libraries.\n"
